        What data do we collect? <br />
        We collect the personal information you voluntarily provide, which may include following data:
        Personal identification information such as your first and last name, email address, phone number and year of birth
        Body anthropometric information such as body statistics, photos, progress as well as genetic, biometric and health data
        Preferences related to food and training activities
        How do we collect your data?
        You directly provide us with the data we collect. We collect data and process data when you:
        Register online or place an order for any of our services.
        Voluntarily complete a client survey or provide feedback on any of our forms or via email.
        Complete a consultation either through phone call communications or completing forms.
        Update us through email, direct text messaging or phone call communication regarding changes in your body for the coaching service.
        How will we use your data?
        We collect your data so that we can:
        Process your order and manage your account.
        Provide and maintain individualised and tailored nutrition and training plans.
        Keep in contact with you by email, telephone calls, SMS, or other equivalent forms of electronic communication, in order to get updates and feedback on your progress in both nutrition and training.
        Analyse the information collected from updates to be used in order to make informed decisions on how to proceed with your nutrition and/or training service.
        Attend and manage your requests to us.
        How will we share your data?
        We provide information to other service providers who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. This includes payment processing, email delivery and hosting services.

        We do not and will never sell your data to any 3rd party service providers. We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so.

        How do we store your data?
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. We securely store your data locally, on hardware encrypted servers.

        How long do we store your data?
        We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements to resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies).

        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

        Marketing
        We will not send you information about products or services of ours or of any other companies.
